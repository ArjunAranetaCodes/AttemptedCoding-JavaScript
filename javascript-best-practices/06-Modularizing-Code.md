# Modularizing Code: One Function Per Task
Keeping your JavaScript code organized and maintainable is crucial as your projects grow in complexity. One effective technique is to follow the principle of "one function per task."
<br/>
By breaking your code into small, focused functions that each handle a single responsibility, you can create a more modular and scalable codebase. This makes it easier to understand, debug, and update your application over time.

Here's an example of how you might structure a function to handle user authentication:
```javascript
// Authentication module
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // Validate user input
  if (!username || !password) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Please enter a username and password.' };
  }

  // Check credentials against database
  const user = getUserFromDatabase(username, password);
  if (!user) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Invalid username or password.' };
  }

  // Log user in
  loginUser(user);
  return { success: true, user: user };
}

function getUserFromDatabase(username, password) {
  // Code to fetch user from database
  // ...
}

function loginUser(user) {
  // Code to log user in
  // ...
}
```

By separating the authentication logic into its own module with focused functions, you can easily test, maintain, and reuse this code across your application.
