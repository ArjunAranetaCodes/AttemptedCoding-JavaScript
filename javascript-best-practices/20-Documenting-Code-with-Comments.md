# Documenting Code with Comments: The Key to Maintainable JavaScript
As JavaScript developers, we often find ourselves working on complex projects that require meticulous attention to detail. One of the most important practices we can adopt to ensure the long-term success of our code is the art of documenting our work through the use of comments.
<br/>
Comments are more than just a way to explain what our code does - they are the roadmap that guides our future selves and our fellow developers through the intricate maze of our applications. By taking the time to document our code, we not only make it easier to understand and maintain, but we also demonstrate our commitment to writing clean, professional-grade software.

<br/>

Here's a simple example of how comments can enhance the readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code:
```javascript
// Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
function calculateRectangleArea(width, height) {
  // Check if the input values are valid
  if (typeof width !== 'number' || typeof height !== 'number' || width <= 0 || height <= 0) {
    return 'Invalid input. Width and height must be positive numbers.';
  }

  // Calculate the area of the rectangle
  const area = width * height;

  // Return the calculated area
  return area;
}

// Example usage
const rectangleWidth = 5;
const rectangleHeight = 10;
const areaResult = calculateRectangleArea(rectangleWidth, rectangleHeight);
console.log(`The area of the rectangle is ${areaResult} square units.`);
```
By adding clear and concise comments, we've made it easier for ourselves and others to understand the purpose of the calculateRectangleArea function, the input validation process, and the calculation of the area. This level of documentation not only helps maintain the code in the long run but also serves as a valuable resource for anyone who needs to work on or extend the functionality of the application.
<br/>
Remember, well-documented code is the hallmark of a professional developer. So, the next time you write JavaScript, take a moment to add those valuable comments - your future self (and your team) will thank you for it!
