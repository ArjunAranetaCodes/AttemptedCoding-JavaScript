# Development Code is Not Live Code
As developers, it's important to remember that the code we write during the development process is not the same as the code that runs in a live production environment. There are often crucial differences between the two that we need to be aware of.
## The Differences Between Development and Live Code
* Environment Variables: Development code often relies on local environment variables that may not exist in the live environment. These need to be properly configured for the live system.
* Dependencies: The dependencies and versions used in development may not match what is installed in production. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
* Configuration: Development settings like debug modes, logging levels, and other configurations are usually different from live.
* Security: Development environments are often less secure than production to allow for easier testing and debugging. Live code needs to have proper security measures in place.
* Performance: Code that works fine in a development environment may not scale or perform well in a live production setting with real user traffic.

## A Code Snippet to Illustrate the Concept
Here's a simple example in JavaScript that demonstrates the difference between development and live code:
```javascript
// Development Code
const apiKey = process.env.DEV_API_KEY;

// Live Code 
const apiKey = process.env.LIVE_API_KEY;
```

In this case, the development code uses the DEV_API_KEY environment variable, while the live code uses the LIVE_API_KEY variable.

Deploying the development code to production without updating the API key would result in a broken integration.

Always remember - development code is not live code! Take the time to properly configure, test, and deploy your application to ensure a smooth transition from development to production.
