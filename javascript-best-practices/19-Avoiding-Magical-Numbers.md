# Avoid Magical Numbers in Your JavaScript Code
As JavaScript developers, we often encounter "magical numbers" in our code - those random-looking numeric values that don't seem to have any clear meaning or purpose. While they may work in the moment, using magical numbers is generally considered a bad practice that can lead to maintainability and readability issues down the line.
<br/>
Instead, we should strive to make our code more self-documenting by replacing these mysterious numbers with named constants or variables that clearly communicate their purpose. This not only makes the code easier to understand, but also makes it more flexible 
and easier to update in the future.
<br/>

Here's an example of how you can refactor some code to avoid magical numbers:
```javascript
// Magical numbers
const x = 86400000; // Number of milliseconds in a day
const y = 7; // Number of days in a week

// Refactored with named constants
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400000;
const DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7;

const daysSinceLastWeek = (Date.now() - lastWeekTimestamp) / MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY;
const weeksAgo = Math.floor(daysSinceLastWeek / DAYS_PER_WEEK);
```
By using descriptive names like MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY and DAYS_PER_WEEK, the code becomes much more self-explanatory and easier to maintain. If you ever need to change the number of milliseconds in a day or the number of days in a week, you only need to update the constant values in one place.
<br/>
Avoiding magical numbers is just one of many best practices that can help you write cleaner, more maintainable JavaScript code. Give it a try in your next project!
