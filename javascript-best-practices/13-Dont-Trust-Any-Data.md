# Don't Trust Any Data in JavaScript
As JavaScript developers, we often work with data from various sources - user input, APIs, databases, and more. However, it's crucial to remember that we can't always trust this data. Blindly accepting and using untrusted data can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior in our applications.

In this post, we'll explore why it's important to validate and sanitize data in JavaScript, and provide a code snippet to help you get started.
## Why You Can't Trust Any Data
There are several reasons why you should never trust any data in JavaScript:
* User Input: Users can intentionally or unintentionally provide malicious input, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Third-Party APIs: APIs from external sources may return data that doesn't conform to the expected format or contains unexpected values.
* Database Queries: Data stored in databases can be corrupted or tampered with, leading to unexpected results.

Failing to properly validate and sanitize data can result in security vulnerabilities, data corruption, and unexpected application behavior.

## Sanitizing User Input in JavaScript
To protect your application from untrusted data, it's essential to sanitize all user input before using it. Here's a simple example of how to sanitize a user's input using the DOMPurify library:
```javascript
const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');

// Get user input
const userInput = document.getElementById('user-input').value;

// Sanitize the input
const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);

// Use the sanitized input
console.log(sanitizedInput);
```
In this example, we use the DOMPurify library to remove any potentially malicious HTML tags or attributes from the user's input. This helps prevent XSS attacks and ensures that the data is safe to use in our application.

Remember, it's crucial to sanitize all user input, regardless of the source or intended use. By following this practice, you can protect your application and your users from the dangers of untrusted data.
