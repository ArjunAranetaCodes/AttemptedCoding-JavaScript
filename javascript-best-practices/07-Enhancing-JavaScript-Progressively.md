# Enhancing JavaScript Progressively
As web developers, we're always looking for ways to improve the user experience and make our applications more efficient. One powerful technique is progressive enhancement - building a solid foundation with HTML and CSS, then progressively adding JavaScript to enhance the functionality.
<br/>
This approach ensures that your website or web app remains accessible and usable even if the user's browser doesn't support the latest JavaScript features. It also helps to improve performance by only loading the necessary scripts and resources.
<br/>

Here's a simple example of how you might implement progressive enhancement with JavaScript:
```javascript
// Check if the browser supports the necessary features
if ('querySelector' in document && 'addEventListener' in window) {
  // Add event listener to a button
  document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Enhance the user experience with JavaScript
    this.classList.add('clicked');
    alert('You clicked the button!');
  });
} else {
  // Provide a fallback experience without JavaScript
  document.querySelector('button').textContent = 'Click me';
}
```

In this example, we first check if the browser supports the necessary features (in this case, querySelector and addEventListener). If the features are supported, we add an event listener to a button and enhance the user experience with JavaScript. If the features are not supported, we provide a fallback experience by simply setting the button's text.
<br/>

By taking this progressive approach, we ensure that our web application remains functional and accessible to all users, while still providing an enhanced experience for those with modern browsers.
